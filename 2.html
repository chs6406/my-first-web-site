    <h2>Agnès VARDA</h2>
    <p>Bonjour tout le monde</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnès_Varda" target="_blank" title="en.wikipedia">Agnès VARDA</a>
        was a Belgian-born French <strong> film director, screenwriter, photographer, and artist.</strong> Her
        pioneering work was central
        to the development of the widely influential <u>French New Wave</u> film movement of the 1950s and 1960s.<br>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;">Varda's work employed location shooting in an era when the limitations of sound
        technology made it easier and more common to film indoors, with constructed sets and painted backdrops of
        landscapes, rather than outdoors, on location. Her use of non-professional actors was also unconventional for
        1950s French cinema. Varda's feature film debut was La Pointe Courte (1955), followed by Cléo from 5 to 7
        (1962), one of her most notable narrative films, Vagabond (1985), and Kung Fu Master (1988). Varda was also
        known for her work as a documentarian with such works as Black Panthers (1968), The Gleaners and I (2000), The
        Beaches of Agnès (2008), Faces Places (2017), and her final film, Varda by Agnès (2019).</p>
