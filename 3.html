        Chantal Anne Akerman (French 6 June 1950 - 5 October 2015) was a Belgian <strong>film director, screenwriter,
            artist, and film professor</strong> at the City College of New York.<br>
        According to multiple critics and film scholars, Akerman's <u>influence on feminist and avant-garde cinema</u>
        is substantial, with at least one scholar calling her "one of the most significant directors of our times."<br>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;">Akerman's filming style relies on capturing ordinary life. By encouraging viewers to
        have patience with a slow pace, her films emphasize the humanity of the everyday. Art curator Kathy
        Halbreich writes that Akerman "creates a cinema of waiting, of passages, of resolutions deferred".
        Many of Akerman's films portray the movement of people across distances or their absorption with claustrophobic
        spaces. Curator Jon Davies writes that her domestic interiors "conceal gendered labour and violence, secrecy
        and shame, where traumas both large and small unfold with few if any witnesses". Akerman addresses the
        voyeurism that is always present within cinematic discourse by often playing a character within her films,
        placing herself on both sides of the camera simultaneously. She used the boredom of structuralism to
        generate a bodily feeling in the viewer, accentuating the passage of time.[</p>
