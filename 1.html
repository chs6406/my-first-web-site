    <p style="margin-top:20px;">Jean-Luc Godard was born in Paris on December 3, 1930, the second of four children in a
        bourgeois Franco-Swiss family.
        His father was a doctor who owned a private clinic, and his mother came from a preeminent family of Swiss
        bankers.
        During World War II Godard became a naturalized citizen of Switzerland and attended school in Nyons,
        Switzerland. His
        parents divorced in 1948, at which time he returned to Paris to attend the Lycée Rohmer. In 1949 he studied at
        the
        Sorbonne to prepare for a degree in ethnology.</p>
